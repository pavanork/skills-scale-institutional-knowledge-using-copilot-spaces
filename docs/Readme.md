# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Quick summary
OctoAcme uses an agile, iterative project management approach focused on short feedback loops, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Primary phases are initiation, planning, execution & tracking, risk & communication management, release & deployment, and retrospective-driven improvements. Roles and responsibilities are documented to support accountability and knowledge sharing across teams.

This README is an index and short orientation to the full project management docs stored in this folder.

## Project management processes (overview)
- Initiation — Define objectives, scope, high-level stakeholders, and success criteria. Create an initial business case and identify constraints.
- Planning — Break work into deliverables and iterations, set milestones, estimate effort, and align on priorities and acceptance criteria.
- Execution & tracking — Run work in short cycles (sprints or iterations), use visible boards and regular standups, track progress against milestones, and keep commitments transparent.
- Risk, issue & communication management — Proactively identify and log risks, assign mitigations, and keep stakeholders informed with a clear communication plan.
- Release & deployment — Coordinate final acceptance, prepare release runbooks, verify release readiness, and perform post-deploy validation.
- Retrospective & continuous improvement — Hold regular retrospectives, capture action items, and drive measurable process improvements.
- Roles & responsibilities — Define role-based expectations (product/PM, engineering lead, QA, release owner, etc.) and maintain living persona docs.

- Keep docs up to date: propose edits via PR and reference the issue or epic that drove the change.

## Contribution and review
- Create a branch per change and open a PR.
- Link PRs to the relevant issue (for example, "Closes #2" or "Refs #2") so work is discoverable.
- Request reviewers from the relevant roles (product, QA, engineering lead).
